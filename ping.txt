!
! 1. Process with rank 0 begins by sending the first message assuming 
!    "msg_recv=0".
!
! 2. In an endless loop, all processes wait for a message from any process.
!    There are two possible types of a message:
!    - "normal" message is a real number "msg_recv"
!    - "end-of-game" message
!
!   The type of a message can be defined either by a different tag or by a
!   special value of "msg_recv" (differentiation by tag is preferred).
!
! 3. When a process receives "end-of-game" message it stops waiting for more
!    messages and exits the loop.

! 4. When a process receives "normal" message, but the received value is
!    larger than a some threshold (msg_recv > msg_threshold), it sends
!    "end-of-game" messages to all other processes and exits the loop.
!
! 5. When a process receives "normal" message with received value less than
!    the threshold, then the process:
!
!   - generates a random real number "x" in the range <0; 1) and
!     adds it to the received value "msg_recv"
!     (new message value "msg_send" will be "msg_recv" + "x"); 
!   - generates randomly an integer "j" in the range <0; np-1> in such a way
!     that "j" is not the rank of the actual process;
!   - sends a "normal" message "msg_send" to the process with the rank "j";
!   - prints "msg_send", its rank and the rank of the process where the
!     message has been send to;
!   - increments its counter of sent messages;
!   - resumes waiting for further messages.
!
! 6. After exiting the loop, every process prints its rank and the number of
!    messages it has send.
!
! Optional extensions:
!
! 7. At the beginning, before sending the first message, the root can
!    prompt the user for the threshold value and then broadcast this
!    value to other processes.
!
! 8. Apart from printing the number of messages send, processes send this
!    value to the root (try to use MPI_GATHER). The root than prints this
!    statistics for every process and the total number of send messages.
!
! Here is an example of the output:
! $ mpirun -np 4 ./a2.exe 
!
! What is the threshold ? 5
! Send 0 to 2 Message   0.789020
! Send 2 to 3 Message   1.056683
! Send 3 to 1 Message   1.883816
! Send 1 to 3 Message   2.505021
! Send 3 to 0 Message   3.335455
! Send 0 to 2 Message   4.230506
! Send 2 to 1 Message   4.476061
! Send 1 to 0 Message   4.670770
! Send 0 to 3 Message   5.060951
! Rank 0 has send 3 messages
! Rank 1 has send 2 messages
! Rank 2 has send 2 messages
! Rank 3 has send 2 messages
! Statistics: 3 2 2 2
